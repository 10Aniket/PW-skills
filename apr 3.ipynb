    "Both precision and recall are important metrics in evaluating the performance of a classification model, and they are often used together to give a more complete picture of the model's performance. In some cases, it may be more important to optimize for precision (e.g., in medical diagnosis), while in other cases, recall may be more important (e.g., in fraud detection)."

    "Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm that works by modeling the probability of the positive class given the features of an input.
