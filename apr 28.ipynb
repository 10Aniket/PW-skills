    "Hierarchical clustering is useful when exploring the inherent structure and relationships within the data. It is particularly suitable for scenarios where the number of clusters is unknown or when a fine-grained understanding of the clustering hierarchy is desired. However, it can be computationally intensive for large datasets and may require decisions regarding appropriate distance measures and linkage criteria for merging or splitting clusters."

Agglomerative clustering is more commonly used due to its computational efficiency and ability to handle large datasets. Divisive clustering tends to be more computationally expensive and is less widely used. The choice between the two depends on the specific requirements of the problem and the desired granularity of the clustering hierarchy."
