    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines features of both Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression. It was introduced to overcome some limitations of Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression when applied to high-dimensional data sets with strong correlations between predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression introduces two tuning parameters: alpha (α) and lambda (λ). Alpha controls the balance between L1 and L2 penalties, where L1 penalty refers to the absolute value of the coefficients and L2 penalty refers to the square of the coefficients. When alpha is set to 1, the model performs Lasso Regression, and when alpha is set to 0, the model performs Ridge Regression. When alpha is between 0 and 1, the model performs a combination of both Lasso and Ridge Regression."

    "Advantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable selection: Elastic Net Regression can handle correlated predictors and perform variable selection like Lasso Regression. It can reduce the number of predictors used in the final model, which can improve model interpretability and generalization performance.\n",
    "Bias-variance tradeoff: Elastic Net Regression strikes a balance between Ridge Regression and Lasso Regression, combining the strengths of both techniques. It can reduce the impact of irrelevant predictors like Ridge Regression, while also selecting relevant predictors like Lasso Regression.\n",
    "Robustness: Elastic Net Regression can handle situations where there are more predictors than observations and can deal with multicollinearity issues.\n",
    "Disadvantages of Elastic Net Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: Elastic Net Regression has two tuning parameters, alpha and lambda, that must be tuned to optimize the model. This can make model selection more complicated than Ridge or Lasso Regression, which only have one tuning parameter.\n",
    "Computational cost: Tuning the two parameters in Elastic Net Regression can be computationally expensive and time-consuming, especially for large data sets.\n",
    "Interpretation: The final model may still contain many predictors, which can make it difficult to interpret.\n",
    "In summary, Elastic Net Regression is a useful technique for handling high-dimensional data sets with strong correlations between predictors. It can achieve better predictive accuracy than either Ridge or Lasso Regression alone, while still performing variable selection. However, it requires more computational resources and may still result in a complex model that is difficult to interpret."

    "Prediction modeling: Elastic Net Regression is useful for building prediction models when the goal is to select a subset of predictors that have the greatest impact on the outcome variable.\n",

    "Feature selection: Elastic Net Regression can be used to identify the most important predictors in a data set, providing a more interpretable model that can be used for feature selection.\n",
