The penalty term has the effect of reducing the size of the coefficients, particularly those that are less important or have little predictive power, without eliminating them completely."

For example, for nominal variables (where there is no inherent ordering of the categories), one-hot encoding can be used to create a binary variable for each category, where a value of 1 indicates the presence of that category and 0 otherwise. For ordinal variables (where there is a natural ordering of the categories), a numerical value can be assigned to each category based on its position in the ordering."

For small values of lambda, the coefficients are similar to those obtained from OLS regression and can be interpreted directly. For larger values of lambda, the coefficients are shrunk towards zero, and their magnitudes become smaller, which can make them more difficult to interpret. In this case, the focus may be more on the relative magnitudes of the coefficients rather than their absolute values."

The lagged variables represent the values of the dependent variable at different time points in the past, and their inclusion in the regression model allows for the modeling of time-series dependencies and autocorrelation."
