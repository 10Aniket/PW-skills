    "Handling Missing Values: Check for missing values in the time series data and decide on an appropriate strategy to handle them. This may involve imputing missing values using techniques such as interpolation, forward filling, or backward filling.\n",

This can be done by aggregating the data over specific time periods, such as hourly, daily, or monthly intervals.\n",

Other models like exponential smoothing methods can also be appropriate for stationary time series.\n",
