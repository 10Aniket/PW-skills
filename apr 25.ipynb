    "Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are concepts used in linear algebra to understand the behavior of linear transformations. An eigenvector of a square matrix is a non-zero vector that, when multiplied by the matrix, yields a scalar multiple of itself, known as the eigenvalue.

They are related to eigenvalues in that when a matrix is multiplied by one of its eigenvectors, the result is a scalar multiple of that same eigenvector, where the scalar multiple is the corresponding eigenvalue. In other words, the eigenvectors of a matrix are the non-zero vectors that are unchanged in direction by the matrix transformation, but only scaled by the corresponding eigenvalue.
