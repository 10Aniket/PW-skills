    "Ordinal Encoding is preferred over Label Encoding when there is an inherent ordering or ranking among the categories. For example, in the \"education level\" example above, there is a clear ordering among the categories based on the level of education. In contrast, for a categorical variable like \"color\", there is no inherent ordering or ranking, so Label Encoding is more appropriate.\n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that replaces categorical variables with ordinal numbers based on the target variable's mean in each category. The idea behind this technique is that it encodes the categories such that categories with similar mean target values are assigned the same encoded value. This technique is useful in cases where there is a strong correlation between the target variable and the categorical variable, making it a powerful feature for prediction."

    "Covariance is a measure of the relationship between two variables. Specifically, it measures how changes in one variable are related to changes in another variable. If two variables are positively related, meaning that when one increases, the other tends to increase as well, then their covariance will be positive. If two variables are negatively related, meaning that when one increases, the other tends to decrease, then their covariance will be negative. If two variables are unrelated, then their covariance will be close to zero.\n",

    "Covariance is important in statistical analysis because it can help us understand how variables are related to one another. For example, if we are trying to predict the price of a house based on its size and location, we might want to know how much those two variables are related to one another. If they are highly positively related, then we might be able to use one variable to predict the other with a high degree of accuracy."
